# CK

MLPerf uses a tool called [CK - Collective Knowledge](https://github.com/evelynmitchell/ck) with docs at [CK docs](https://ck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to structure and organize the project.

"Collective Knowledge framework (CK) helps to organize any software project as a database of reusable components (algorithms, datasets, models, frameworks, scripts, experimental results, papers, etc) with common automation actions and extensible meta descriptions based on FAIR principles (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability)."
